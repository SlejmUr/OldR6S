Use plaza_bo, if it doesn't work, use plaza_new
If the game is stuck on preparing content go into codex.ini and set offline=1 to offline=0
Once you have grab the PLAZA's in "Resources\Plazas" and copy its contents to your game folder.
When it asks to overwrite a few files click yes. If your anti-virus blocks these files then make sure to allow them.
